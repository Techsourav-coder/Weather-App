# Weather-App
Create a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! Fetch real-time data from a weather API like OpenWeather. Use JS to call the API, display current weather, and style it with CSS for a sleek look. Add location-based updates for a personal touchâ€”simple, functional, and user-friendly
Creating a weather app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a great way to combine web development skills with real-time data. The app's structure starts with a simple HTML layout, including an input field for city names and a button to fetch weather data. JavaScript interacts with an API like OpenWeather to retrieve current weather details such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions, displaying them dynamically on the page. CSS is used to style the app, ensuring a visually appealing interface with responsive design for mobile users. You can enhance the app by adding geolocation to automatically detect the user's location or a 5-day forecast for extended weather details. Custom icons or background images can reflect the weather conditions, making the app more engaging. Error handling ensures the app remains functional even with incorrect inputs, and features like unit conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit improve user experience. This project offers a simple yet functional example of how to fetch and display data from an API, providing users with a helpful and interactive tool while sharpening your web development skills.
